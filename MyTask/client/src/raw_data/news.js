      "New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index shed 0.8% to 12,166 on Monday, erasing earlier gains to close at its lowest level since July, as signs of an uneven recovery from recession weighed on sentiment. Survey data showed New Zealand’s services sector contracted in February due to declining sales and orders. Limiting losses were fresh initiatives from key trading partner China aimed at boosting domestic consumption. Traders now await Q4 GDP data this week, expected to show a slight rebound in the Kiwi economy. Utilities were among the biggest laggards, with Mercury NZ, Contact Energy, and Meridian Energy declining between 1.2% and 2.4%. Among major stocks, only infrastructure investor Infratil gained, rising 2.2%.",

      "The New Zealand dollar climbed to around $0.578 on Monday, its highest level since last December, supported by ongoing US dollar weakness amid trade uncertainties and growing economic concerns. The antipodean currency also benefited from upbeat data from China, a key trading partner, as retail sales rose in line with forecasts. This comes after China introduced a targeted initiative over the weekend to stimulate consumption through salary increases, higher household spending, and efforts to steady stock and real estate markets. Domestically, survey data on the services sector signaled an uneven recovery from recession, reinforcing the case for further rate cuts in line with the central bank’s indication of additional easing last month. Traders now await Q4 GDP data this week, expected to show a slight rebound in the Kiwi economy.",

      "The stock market in New Zealand added 29 points, or 0.2%, to 12,296 around noon on Monday, trying to maintain the rise from last week amid gains mostly from financials, communication services, and industrials. A rally on Wall Street on Friday also helped lift sentiment due to easing worries over the government shutdown. Investors digested a special action plan that was launched in New Zealand's top trading partner, China, on Sunday to boost domestic consumption. However, traders awaited the release of a series of economic data in China later today, including retail sales and industrial production, while anticipating the Fed's interest rate decision later this week. Domestically, a return to contraction in New Zealand's services sector limited the gains due to falls in sales, new orders, and employment. Heavyweight Infratil added 1.6%, followed by Westpac Banking Corp. (1.3%), Delegat Group (1.1%), Mainfreight (0.9%), South Port New Zealand (0.7%), Chorus (0.5%), and ANZ Group (0.3%)",
